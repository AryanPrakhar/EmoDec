This project aims to build a real-time emotion detection system using deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to recognize facial emotions from images. The system utilizes popular Python libraries, including matplotlib, numpy, pandas, and Keras, for data manipulation, visualization, and model creation.

The trained model is deployed to perform real-time emotion detection using the camera feed. The Haar Cascade classifier is used to detect faces in the video stream, and the emotion labels are displayed on the detected faces. The program runs in a loop until the user stops the execution.
